The project is made with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Relm4](https://relm4.org/) library: a high-level component-based framework inspired by [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) for building GUI applications, built on top of [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/).

It was originally developed as a GNOME application written in C using GNOME Builder as the IDE and Cambalache to build the UI, but it has since been rewritten to use Rust and the Relm4 library.
